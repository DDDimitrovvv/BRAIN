You can make the same sorting without using a vector sorting function. 
For choice '1': you can use a Multi-dimensional Array and two arrays 
(one to store a strings - separated with delimiter ' ' and one array, 
that store the summ of integers on each string word(summ the ASCII code for each char)). 
After that you can sort the summ of integers and than fill the Multi-dimensional Array with correct string (words) with correct summ. 
You will need a loop to compare all summ in scending order.
